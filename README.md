Basic utility for 1337-ifying text.

Reads first string argument passed and writes result to stdout. Reads from stdin if argument is omitted.

Example: `$ leet 'i want this is 1337 for some reason'
i w4nt thi5 in 1337 f0r 50m3 r3450n
`

Place `leet` in your path for easy access (for example `/usr/local/bin`)
